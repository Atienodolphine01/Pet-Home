        <p>Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats. The technical term for a cat lover is an ailurophile, and for a dog lover, a cynophile. Other animals commonly kept include: rabbits; ferrets; pigs; rodents, such as gerbils, hamsters, chinchillas, rats, mice, and guinea pigs; avian pets, such as parrots, passerines and fowls; reptile pets, such as turtles, alligators, crocodiles, lizards, and snakes; aquatic pets, such as fish, freshwater and saltwater snails, amphibians like frogs and salamanders; and arthropod pets, such as tarantulas and hermit crabs. 
            Small pets may be grouped together as pocket pets, while the equine and bovine group include the largest companion animals.</p>

                <p>Whether you’ve had your cat for her whole life, or you’ve just welcomed a cat or kitten into your new family, you can find yourself learning something new about your cat everyday! Here are a few facts;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first year of a cat’s life is roughly equal to the first 15 years of human life.</li>
                <li>Cats can rotate their ears 180 degrees.</li>
                <li>The hearing of the average cat is at least five times stronger than that of a human adult.</li>
                <li>Domestic cats spend about 70 per cent of the day sleeping and 15 per cent of the day grooming.</li>
            </ul>
        <h1>Interesting facts about dogs</h1>
            <img src="DG_008.jpg">
                <p>Just like cats, dogs are wonderful pets. Here are facts about them;</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Dogs have a sense of time. It's been proven that they know the difference between a hour and five. If conditioned to, they can predict future events, such as regular walk times.</li>
                <li> Your dog is as smart as a two-year old! Ever wonder why children around this age seem to have a special bond with the family dog? It could be because they speak the same language, roughly 250 words and gestures in fact.</li>
                <li>The United States has the highest pet dog population in the world. Approximately 75.8 million in fact.</li>
                <li>Man’s best friend? Petting a dog and gazing into their eyes releases oxytocin (i.e the “love hormone”) not only for you, but for them as well.</li>
